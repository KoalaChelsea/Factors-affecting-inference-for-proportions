# Factors-affecting-inference-for-proportions

This app represents an interactive supplementary module embedded in statistics lessons with two features. The first feature visualizes how the variations in confidence levels and sample size affect the outcome confidence interval in a single mean. The second feature tests the difference between two means by adjusting confidence levels and sample size and generating calculation results with explanations. The app requires students to engage in the interaction with the scenarios provided in context.
